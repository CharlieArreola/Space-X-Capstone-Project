<h2>Summary</h2>
The main objective for this project is to be able to predict if  the 
Falcon 9 from Space X will land have a successful first landing 
stage.
The main reason why Space X has been able to advertise their 
launches to be $62million USD; other providers costs upward of  
$165million USD each. Much of  the savings' difference is due to 
Space X can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, we can know the cost of  the launch if  we determine if  the 
first stage will land. This could be used by any other company who 
wants to bid against SpaceX rocket launch.
